		<h1 id="-hawk-s-christmas-wish-"><strong>Hawk’s Christmas Wish</strong></h1>
<p>Sooo, the phone rings. A jovial, familiar voice says hello and I recognize it as a person whose company we have used for some repair work at our home. I’m thinking, uh-oh did I forget to pay the bill or is it the winter sales call to get business lined up for spring.</p>
<p>He then asks if I have a few minutes for a little story. I laugh and say, “yes, especially it if’s a Christmas story,” since, afterall, it was the week before Christmas. He replies, “as a matter of fact it is.” I’m ready to hear the story, but actually, I never could have been ready for this story...</p>
<p><em>“I had the chance to play Santa last Saturday for 400 people whose kids experience an untold variety of disabilities. I say “kids” but these are kids anywhere from 50 down to 2 years old. These kids were so excited because they were brought here, all obstacles aside, to see Santa. I don’t think I have ever been poked, hugged or kissed so much in my life. You know how a puppy might “piddle” when he gets really, really excited? Well with the sheer excitement of one of the littler ones, that even happened once on my left knee. So I switched everyone to my right knee until it was dry and then we could switch on and off again. The sheer joy of these ‘kids’ was a sight to behold and I realized I had no idea beforehand how this experience would have affected me, just for filling in for the Santa who was unable to be there.</em></p>
<p><em>It was getting towards the end of the Christmas party and I thought I was getting to my last “ho-ho-ho”. Then a mother approached me with her son in a wheelchair. She hoisted this young boy onto my lap. He had an electronic board so he could talk to me, Santa, about his Christmas wish.</em></p>
<p><em>“What’s your name, son?”</em><br><em>
</em>“Hawk,” he replied on his electronic board.<em>
</em><br><em>“So, Hawk, what do you want Santa to bring you for Christmas?”</em><br><em>
</em>Hawk replied on his digital screen, “I want my grandma’s legs to not hurt.”*</p>
<p><em>Knowing that was a pretty tall order I asked again, “Can you tell me something else you want?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes....a van so our family can go on vacation again.”</em></p>
<p><em>I gave it one more try with the hopes that there was some Christmas wish that could logically happen. “Is there something special you want that’s just for you?”</em></p>
<p><em>Hawk answered from his little machine, “Yes, those two things.”</em></p>
<p><em>So we gave each other a big hug and and wished each other a “Merry Christmas”.</em></p>
<p><em>The volunteers had a little recap session right after the party. We went around the table to share our favorite story of the evening since there were so many families who came into contact with each of us as we assisted them in to see Santa.</em></p>
<p><em>I told my story. Another person at the table said, “we need to do something for Hawk.”</em></p>
<p><em>So, with a little inquiring we learned that “grandma’s legs” was really mom’s knee. With a little research, we learned that that it was a definite possibility that wish could come true.</em></p>
<p><em>But the van was a different story. I found a used one, found a lift for the back, realized it wasn’t going to be there if I blinked...so I bought it. The generosity of a local auto business will help maintain it, oil changes and such....</em></p>
<p><em>“Would you like to help with the gift of the van?”</em></p>
<p><em>I actually couldn’t say anything for a couple seconds. Of course we would I told him as I hung up the phone.</em></p>
<p>This was clearly about a whole lot more than Hawk’s Christmas Wish.</p>
